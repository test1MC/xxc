        <h1>CLASSIC CARS</h1>
        <p>For insurance and registration purposes, the age of a classic car, in most cases, is <b>at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old</b>. If you are going to register it (and insure it) as a classic, it should have been kept to its original design and specifications.</p>
