        <p>It was all about love. Subaru drivers loved life. They loved the outdoors. They loved pets. They especially loved the venerable old Subaru they’d been driving forever. The Love campaign was born. In the years since, sales and market share have more than tripled. Love has spread to every level of the brand. This opens in a new window.</p>

            <p>Meaning and History Subaru-Fuji Industries Ltd is the first Japanese car maker, which uses the name taken from the native language. The group of stars of the logo in its original name sounds as mutsuraboshi (in translation from Japanese, it means “<b>in the constellation of the Taurus</b>”).</p>

        <p>Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.</p>
