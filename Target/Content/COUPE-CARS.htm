                <p>A coupe is defined as <b>a closed roof, 2-door passenger car with a three-box body for the engine and the passenger compartment</b>. Most importantly, a coupe is a vehicle with interior space that is under 33 cubic feet.</p>

        <p>Throughout the Honda lineup, you will find both coupe and sedan models. When it comes to sedans, the Civic and Accord are two of the most popular options among Tuscumbia and Sheffield drivers. <b>The Civic is also offered in a coupe configuration.</b></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If more room is desired, two-door, four- or five-passenger coupes maintain that performance orientation with even more practical usage. <b>Less practical examples include the Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang</b>, and Lexus RC. More practical coupes include the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series, Dodge Challenger, and Honda Civic coupe.</p>
